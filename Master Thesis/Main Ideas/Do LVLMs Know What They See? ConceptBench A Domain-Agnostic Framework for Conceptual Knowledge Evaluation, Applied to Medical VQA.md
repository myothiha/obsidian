What is conceptual knowledge?

A concept is an abstract representation of how we understand everything about the world. A concept can be something concrete that we have experience with our five senses such as dogs, cats, fruits or it can be something abstract such as love, hate and trust. Conceptual knowledge are generally refer to as knowledge about concepts. When human can learn knowledge about the concepts and applied or share those knowledge. Common sense knowledge such as water can be drink and fire can be used to cook meal are useful in every day tasks. There are other knowledge that is related to specific domains where only professionals in those domain will know about such as medical knowledge. Therefore, to perform a professional task will require corresponding conceptual knowledge in that domain. 

There is no single definition of conceptual knowledge we need to define what are concepts and what are knowledge about those concept. Knowledge about a single entity can be described with their properties and functions. Properties are related to composition and state of the target entity. For example, common knowledge like water is cold, fire is hot are properties of water and fire. Their functions can be described how they work and how they used such as bicycle and car are transportation vehicles. While car need fuel to work, bicycle does not require any fuel. Those knowledge are usually about common and general about an entity. 

Conceptual knowledge are knowledge related to each other. Concepts are interlinking each other rather than separate entity and they are connected in many different ways depending on the type of the knowledge and context.
