# Summary



# Problem Statement

Why RAG?

LLMs' knowledge (parameters) are limited to the training data they've been trained. So, they knowledge are usually outdated.
RAG use non-parametric retrieval modules to get external information from documents during the inference.

Challenges
1. Retrieval noise and Redundancy
2. Misalignment between retrieved evidence and generated text can lead to hallucination.
3. pipeline inefficiencies.

# Architecture

Components of RAG
- Query Encoder
- Retriever
- Generator

Note: **Variants of RAG** differ in how they estimate and combine these components. Some use a fixed retriever and let the generator handle noisy inputs, while others jointly optimize retrieval and generation to maximize downstream utility.

## 1. Retriever Based RAG Systems

They assume that retrieving relevant and reliable context are the most critical factors for accurate and grounded generation. 

**Common Design Patterns**
- Input Query Enhancement
- Retrieval Adaption
- Retrieval granularity optimization

**Input Query enhancement** 

A prominent strategy focuses on refining and structuring user intent before retrieval to maximize alignment with relevant corpus segments. 

Notable examples include RQ-RAG (Refine Query for RAG) [6], which decomposes multi-hop queries into latent sub-questions, and GMR (Generative Multi-hop Retrieval) [38], which uses a generative LLM to autoregressively formulate complex multi-hop queries. RAG-Fusion [50] further improves recall by combining results from multiple reformulated queries through reciprocal rank fusion [13]. Structured approaches have also emerged: KRAGEN (Knowledge Retrieval Augmented Generation ENgine) [43] introduces graph-ofthoughts prompting to decompose complex queries into subproblems, retrieving relevant subgraphs to guide multi-hop reasoning. Additionally, LQR (Layered Query Retrieval) [25] implements hierarchical planning over multi-hop questions, while Sparse Context Selection [90]

**Retrieval Adaptation**

It modifies the retriever itself through architectural enhancements or task-specific learning.

Example works: Re2G (Retrieve, Rerank, Generate) [20] blends symbolic and neural retrieval via reranking layers, while SimRAG (Self-Improving RAG) [73] employs self-training over synthetic QA pairs to improve domain generalization. Frameworks like RankRAG [83] and uRAG (unified RAG) [57] emphasize retriever versatility—either by unifying reranking and generation within a single backbone or by training general-purpose retrievers across varied downstream tasks. Additionally, systems such as ToolRerank [88] **dynamically adapt retrieval strategies based on query semantics, optimizing tool selection in specialized retrieval settings.** Relatedly, SEER (Self-Aligned Evidence Extraction for RAG) [87] focuses on **post-retrieval adaptation, advancing corpus-based evidence extraction by aligning evidence selection with faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness criteria**, thereby improving evidence quality for open-domain and temporally sensitive queries.

**Retrieval granularity optimization**

This pattern addresses retrieval precision by optimizing the unit of retrieval—from full documents to fine-grained, semantically aligned segments.

Related Works: LongRAG [31] exemplifies this by retrieving compressed long-context chunks, constructed through document grouping, to better exploit long-context language models. Similarly, FILCO (Filter Context) [69] enhances retrieval granularity by filtering irrelevant or low-utility spans from retrieved passages before generation, improving the faithfulness and efficiency of RAG outputs. In parallel, the Sufficient Context analysis framework [34] offers a complementary lens, evaluating whether retrieved contexts contain enough information to support accurate generation, thereby highlighting the importance of granular retrieval quality for system robustness.

## 2. Generator Based Rag Systems

They assume the retrieved content is sufficiently relevant and shifting the burden of factual grounding and integration to the language model. They enhanced output quality with self-verification, compression and controlled generation.

**Common Design Pattern**
- Faithfulness Aware Decoding
- Context Compression and Utility Filtering
- Retrieval Conditioned Generation Control

**Faithfulness Aware Decoding**

Embed mechanism for self-reflection, verification or correction during generation.

Related works: SELF-RAG (Self-Reflective RAG) [1] introduces a critique–generate loop, allowing the model to assess and revise its outputs before finalization. SelfMem [9] builds on this by incorporating a self-memory module that enables the model to revisit and refine prior generations. INFO-RAG [76] treats the LLM as a de-noising module trained with contrastive objectives.

**Context Compression and Utility Filtering**

It address context window limitations by optimizing retrieval inputs into denser or more structured forms.

Related Works: FiD-Light [24], a streamlined variant of the Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) architecture [27], improves decoding efficiency by compressing encoder outputs across retrieved passages and pruning cross-passage attention without modifying retrieval mechanisms. xRAG [10] projects document embeddings directly into the model’s representation space, minimizing token overhead through modality fusion. Rich Answer Encoding (RAE) [26] enhances retrieval relevance by embedding answer-aligned semantics into retriever outputs rather than relying on token overlap. GenRT [75] further refines retrieval utility by reranking and dynamically truncating

**Retrieval Conditioned Generation Control**

It control and improve output generation which will be guided by retrieval metadata, the type of the task. AI agent can also make dynamic decision using all those information. These architectures are particularly suited to domains where factual correctness, reasoning transparency, or structured output formats are essential—such as biomedical QA, finance, and enterprise workflows.

Related Works: AU-RAG (Agent-based Universal RAG) [28] exemplifies this by using an agent to decide dynamically between retrieved and parametric knowledge across diverse data environments. RAG-Ex [62] perturbs retrieval context to analyze how variability influences model behavior and reliance on external evidence. R2AG (Retrieval information into RAG) [82] extends this by recursively reranking candidates during generation, dynamically prioritizing evidence based on the evolving answer state. In high-stakes domains, Confidence-Calibrated RAG [48] shows that document ordering and prompt structure affect output certainty, highlighting the need for calibration alongside factual accuracy.

## 3. Hybrid RAG Systems

Hybrid RAG frameworks focus on dynamic coordination and feedback between retrieval and generation, allowing for more flexible, iterative, and robust information processing.

Dominant Architectural Patterns
- Iterative or Multi-Round Retrieval
- Utility-Driven Joint Optimization
- Dynamic Retrieval Triggering


**Iterative or Multi-Round Retrieval**

Instead of retrieving all evidence before generating an answer, hybrid systems may alternate retrieval and generation steps, refining the generation as new evidence is fetched. This supports complex reasoning, such as multi-hop question answering, where answering a question requires information from several steps or documents.

Related Works:

IM-RAG (Inner Monologue RAG) [80] simulates an “inner monologue” by alternating between generation and retrieval phases, supporting multi-step reasoning. Generate-Then-Ground (GenGround) [59] follows a similar philosophy, generating a provisional answer first and then retrieving supporting evidence to substantiate or revise it—improving factuality and interpretability in multi-hop settings. G-Retriever [22] retrieves graph-structured subcomponents as generation unfolds, enhancing complex reasoning over textual graphs.

**Utility-Driven Joint Optimization**

Hybrid systems often optimize the retriever and generator together, using feedback from generation to adjust retrieval strategies (similarity scores, sparse). Some use reinforcement learning or joint objectives, aligning the retrieval with the utility for generation instead of static similarity scores.

Related Works:
Stochastic RAG [84] treats retrieval as an expected utility maximization problem, updating both retriever and generator end-to-end using REINFORCE-based gradients. M-RAG [70] applies multi-agent reinforcement learning, coordinating distributed retrievers and generators via shared memory and task-specific roles. MedGraphRAG [72] integrates knowledge graphs into the joint learning loop, facilitating domain-specific reasoning with structured priors. These systems improve factuality and answer consistency, particularly in biomedical and enterprise domains.

**Dynamic Retrieval Triggering**

**Retrieval can be triggered during generation, not just before.** For instance, DRAGIN activates retrieval at the token level using entropy-based signals, while FLARE selectively retrieves when the model is uncertain about the next word or sentence. Self-ROUTE routes tasks dynamically between retrieval/generation based on difficulty estimation, and TA-ARE uses classifiers to decide if/when retrieval is necessary and what granularity is needed.

Related Works:
DRAGIN (Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Information Needs of LLMs) [61] triggers retrieval at the token level using entropy-based confidence signals, while FLARE (Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation () [32] selectively retrieves based on low-confidence predictions during sentence generation. SELF-ROUTE [41] dynamically routes tasks between retrieval and generation modules based on model self-assessed difficulty, and AU-RAG [28] leverages agentic decisionmaking to mediate between diverse retrieval sources and procedural knowledge. TA-ARE (Time-Aware Adaptive REtrieval) [86] introduces a retrieval trigger classifier that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and adjusts the granularity of evidence based on query needs. A related approach, CRAG (Corrective RAG) [79], evaluates retrieved evidence quality before generation and dynamically decides whether to proceed with generation, re-trigger retrieval, or decompose the input into simpler sub-queries. This corrective mechanism positions CRAG within the hybrid class, as it tightly coordinates retrieval assessment with adaptive generation pathways under uncertainty.

## 4. Robustness Oriented

Robustness and security-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are specifically designed to maintain output quality when faced with noisy, irrelevant, or adversarial retrieval contexts. While classic RAG pipelines aim for factual correctness using external evidence, these systems address realistic “worst-case scenarios” that can arise during deployment—such as misleading evidence, retrieval failures, or even deliberate manipulation of the knowledge base.

**Common Strategies**
- Noise Adaptive Training Objectives
- Hallucination Aware Decoding Constraints
- Adversarial Robustness and Security

**Noise Adaptive Training Objectives**

- These systems are trained to be resilient against degraded, irrelevant, or adversarial input evidence.
- For example, **RAAT** categorizes retrieved passages (relevant, irrelevant, counterfactual) and uses adversarial training to optimize worst-case model performance.
- “Information Bottleneck” filtering compresses context to retain just the most useful evidence, discarding noisy information to improve answer precision.

Related Works:
RAAT [18] classifies retrieved passages into relevant, irrelevant, or counterfactual categories and introduces an adversarial training objective to maximize worstcase performance. Bottleneck Noise Filtering [89] applies information bottleneck theory to identify the intersection of useful and noisy information, compressing retrieved context into minimal, high-utility representations. These approaches are particularly effective in retrieval-heavy pipelines where context precision cannot be guaranteed.

**Hallucination Aware Decoding Constraints**

- Focus on reducing factual inaccuracies produced by LLMs when retrieval context is misleading.
- Approaches like **RAGTruth** provide benchmarks and protocols for hallucination detection, guiding improvements in system design.
- Structured retrieval (e.g., executable templates as retrieved context) is also used to constrain output format, particularly for domains where errors are costly (e.g., healthcare).
- Variants such as RAG-Ex inject perturbed documents during training, boosting robustness to inconsistent evidence.

Related Works:
RAGTruth [46] provides benchmarks and evaluation protocols for hallucination detection, guiding system-level design. Structured retrieval-based approaches have also been explored: one method [24] retrieves executable templates (e.g., JSON workflows) to constrain output generation, minimizing reliance on generative interpolation and reducing domain-specific hallucination. RAG-Ex [62] simulates retrieval variability by injecting perturbed documents during training, improving robustness to inconsistent or adversarial context. In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, Confidence-Calibrated RAG [48] explores how document ordering and prompt design affect both answer accuracy and model certainty.

**Adversarial Robustness and Security**

- These methods counteract risks of active attacks—like corpus poisoning or embedding-level backdoors.
- BadRAG [78] and TrojanRAG [8] reveal that maliciously inserted passages can trigger targeted (and hard-to-detect) behaviors from models, even if the base LLM remains unchanged.
- Defensive strategies may include cryptographic document signing, adversarial filtering, or specialized secure retraining, although the latter are not wholly effective and may require further research and proactive design.
- Privacy issues have also emerged, where both retrieval databases and pretrained corpora can be exploited via prompt engineering. Interestingly, retrieval itself can sometimes help reduce memorization leakage by grounding responses in external documents.

## 5 Key Area of Critical Improvement in RAG 

Section 4 of the survey details five key areas where RAG systems have recently seen critical improvements, addressing their main bottlenecks and increasing their real-world effectiveness.

### 1. Retrieval Enhancement

- **Adaptive Retrieval:** Dynamically determines **when to retrieve** (e.g., when model confidence is low), reducing redundant operations for efficiency. Examples include TA-ARE, DRAGIN, and FLARE, showing measurable gains in precision and latency reduction, though sometimes at the expense of **computational overhead**.
- **Multi-source Retrieval:** Retrieves from several knowledge sources (**what to retrieve**) (e.g., AU-RAG, SimRAG), increasing answer coverage and adaptability, especially in evolving or specialized domains, though pipeline complexity rises.
- **Query Refinement:** Refines or decomposes ambiguous user queries (RQ-RAG, R2AG), boosting retrieval relevance and clarity for complex inputs, but **adds extra inference steps and cost.**
- **Hybrid/Structured Retrieval:** Integrates structured (e.g., knowledge graphs) and unstructured sources (e.g., text). Innovations like M-RAG and KRAGEN improve accuracy for tasks needing rich, multi-relational evidence, but tend to be **slower or more memory-intensive.**

### 2. Enhancing Context Relevance through Filtering

Aim to reduce hallucinations by selecting only contextually appropriate content. 

- **Lexical/Statistical Filtering:** Removes non-relevant documents based on token overlap or simple metrics (e.g., FILCO), quickly increasing end-to-end faithfulness but **limited in domain generalization.**
- **Information-Theoretic Filtering:** Uses information bottleneck theory to keep only the most utility-dense evidence (IB Filtering, Stochastic Filtering), offering a trade-off between precision and computational demand.
- **Self-Supervised Filtering:** Employs feedback from the LLM or synthetic judgments (SEER, RAG-Ex) to pick the truly helpful passages, especially valuable in open-ended or long-form tasks—though **training and inference can be costly.**

### 3. Efficiency Optimizations (Relevant to Ph.D Topic)

- **Sparse Selection & Context Reduction:** Selects only “high-signal” context tokens to lower resource demands (**Sparse RAG, R2AG**), but **may discard important details if the retriever is suboptimal**.
- **Inference Acceleration:** Faster decoding and retrieval overlap (FiD-Light, Speculative Pipelining) cut latency, but risk hallucinations or minor precision loss.
- **Caching & Redundancy Reduction:** Schemes like RAGCache reduce recomputation—crucial for highvolume workloads—though cache management can be complex.
- **Retrieval Faithfulness and Answer Relevance:** Improved scoring (RAE) aligns retrieved content with generation needs, boosting factuality at the retraining cost.

FiD-Light and RAGCache demonstrate that passage compression and caching can substantially reduce latency without compromising accuracy. Ablating vector sparsity or caching mechanisms (e.g., speculative pipelining or prefix-aware replacement) increases inference time up to 4×, underscoring the operational significance of architectural optimization in production RAG systems. (p.17)

Taken together, these optimization strategies enhance efficiency across the RAG pipeline: Sparse RAG and R2AG improve alignment between retrieved documents and generation; FiD-Light and Speculative Pipelining reduce latency during inference; RAGCache and PGDSF minimize recomputation in high-throughput environments; and RAE advances retrieval faithfulness. Collectively, they represent a move toward more scalable, accurate, and computationally efficient RAG systems.

### 4. Improving Robustness

- **Noise Mitigation:** Adversarial training (RAAT) and robust inference filtering (CRAG) defend systems against noisy, misleading, or adversarial context, substantially raising F1 scores and precision in difficult scenarios, though setup or training can be expensive.
- **Hallucination Reduction:** Output constraints and iterative refinement (Structured RAG, IM-RAG) directly lower hallucination rates, but **may slow response or need manual updates.**
- **Security Defenses:** Focused on adversarial attacks like corpus poisoning (BadRAG, TrojanRAG), with approaches from filtering to cryptographic integrity checks—but these are only partially effective and comprehensive solutions remain an open problem.

### 5. Reranking Optimization

- **Adaptive Reranking:** Dynamically alters the number of reranked documents for efficiency and better results in real time (RLT, ToolRerank).
- **Unified Pipelines:** Merges ranking and generation for efficiency and consistency (RankRAG, uRAG).
- **Fusion-Based Reranking:** Aggregates and iteratively fuses evidence from multiple queries (RAG-Fusion, R2AG), improving multi-hop robustness but **often increasing latency**.
    

---

These advances collectively make RAG systems significantly more accurate, efficient, and trustworthy for knowledge-intensive applications, while also surfacing new trade-offs between speed, faithfulness, security, and scalability.

# Evaluations

## Evaluation Dimensions 

The core dimensions [55] used to evaluate RAG systems include: 
1. Context Relevance: Measures how pertinent the retrieved documents are to the input query. 
2. Answer Faithfulness: Assesses whether the generated output remains grounded in the retrieved evidence. 
3. Answer Relevance: Evaluates whether the output adequately addresses the user query. 

These dimensions are interdependent: poor context relevance often cascades into reduced faithfulness and answer relevance, underscoring the need for joint evaluation. Frameworks such as ARES and RAGAS have formalized these dimensions, incorporating both automated judgment and reference-free evaluation.

## Automated Evaluation Frameworks 

ARES [55] introduces an LLM-based judge system that uses few-shot prompted language models to generate synthetic datasets. These judges are trained on three classification tasks corresponding to the core dimensions and use prediction powered inference (PPI) to align model-based scoring with human judgment. ARES shows significant improvements in accuracy and annotation efficiency, outperforming RAGAS [17] by up to 59.3 percentage points in context relevance. 

RAGAS employs a modular framework that decomposes generated answers into atomic factual statements, then evaluates each against the retrieved context using LLMs. This structure provides high-resolution feedback, revealing which parts of an answer are hallucinated. 

These frameworks automate the evaluation of faithfulness, grounding, and contextual relevance—enabling scalable, reference-free analysis of RAG performance.

## LLM as an Information Refiner.

eRAG [56] challenges traditional relevance label techniques by applying the RAG generator to each retrieved document individually. INFO-RAG introduces an unsupervised training paradigm that improves the LLM’s ability to refine retrieved information under three scenarios: redundant, noisy, or insufficient context. By viewing the LLM as an “information refiner,” it enables the model to extract relevant content, reject misinformation, and infer missing details—enhancing retrieval robustness without supervised relevance labels.

## Evaluating different RAG Capabilities

1. **Robustness to retrieval noise**. check robustness to noise, negative rejection, information integration and counterfactual resistance. (e.g. RGB [7], RAG-Bench [18])
2. **Faithfulness and hallucination detection** - (e.g. RAGTruth [46])
3. **Reasoning and retrieval chaining** - central to multi-hop question answering, where evidence spans multiple documents. (e.g. MultiHop-RAG [63])
4. **Adaptive retrieval and necessity estimation** - mixes queries requiring external retrieval with those answerable via the base LLM alone (RetrievalQA [86]).  This design tests whether models can intelligently toggle retrieval based on query uncertainty, supporting the development of resource-efficient, retrieval-aware systems that avoid introducing unnecessary context.
5. **Domain-specific evaluation** - MIRAGE [48], a benchmark tailored to medical RAG. incorporates real-world evaluation constraints
6. **Cross-corpus and federated retrieval** - showcase key risks in multi-source RAG pipelines, especially retrieval inconsistency and hallucination amplification due to poor corpus coordination (FeB4RAG [68]).
7. **Evaluation infrastructure and reproducibility** - BERGEN [52], a benchmarking library designed to unify assessment across RAG components.

# Future Directions (Possible Gaps)

- Retrieval Adaptiveness and Semantic alignment - Current RAG architectures often rely on static retrieval policies and fixed embedding transformations, limiting their adaptability to complex or evolving user queries. Future systems must support dynamically calibrated retrieval strategies.
-  Robustness under noise - 
- Multi-Hop Reasoning and Structured Compositionality - solving questions by connecting information from multiple sources or steps; cross-domain generalization
- Cross-Domain Generalization and Temporal Adaptivity - making a system work well in different fields and keeping it current performance.
- Explainability, Personalization, and Trust Calibration - Future architectures should expose transparent interfaces for explaining retrieval decisions and generation provenance.

# Terms Explanations

## Retrievers may be sparse

In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, the term "retrievers may be sparse" refers to a type of retrieval model that relies on sparse representations of text, typically using techniques based on term frequency and document matching rather than dense neural embeddings.

uRAG proposes a unified retrieval system that serves multiple RAG models across diverse downstream tasks. It introduces a shared reranker trained on feedback signals (e.g., EM, accuracy) from various black-box LLMs, treating each LLM as a user of the search engine. uRAG’s training protocol enables evaluation and optimization of retrieval based on downstream task performance, offering retrieval diagnostics grounded in actual utility rather than surface similarity.

## Sparse Retrievers Explained

- **Sparse retrievers** represent texts as high-dimensional, sparse vectors—meaning most values in the vector are zero and only a few are non-zero. This is common in classical Information Retrieval (IR) models.
- The most well-known sparse retriever is **BM25**, a ranking function that uses bag-of-words representations and counts how many times query terms appear in documents, then scores documents based on term frequency, inverse document frequency, and normalizes for document length.
- Sparse retrievers are efficient and interpretable, making them widely used in search engines and IR tasks, especially when retrieval speed and explainability are prioritized.

**Contrast With Dense Retrievers**
- By contrast, **dense retrievers** (like DPR and semantic search models) use neural networks to encode text into continuous dense vectors, capturing semantic similarity across texts but with less direct interpretability.

**Why It Matters in RAG**
- Using sparse retrievers in RAG systems means the retrieval module can leverage established IR algorithms, fast indexing, and efficient matching, particularly useful for very large text corpora or where classic IR methods are effective.
- However, sparse retrievers might fall short when queries and documents are phrased differently or require semantic matching rather than simple keyword overlap, which is where dense retrievers excel.

In summary, "retrievers may be sparse" means the RAG system can use retrieval methods like BM25 or similar, which represent and match texts through sparse, token-based vectors.

## A third strategy modulates generation based on retrieval metadata, task-specific cues, or agentic decision-making

The statement "A third strategy modulates generation based on retrieval metadata, task-specific cues, or agentic decision-making" describes an advanced approach in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems where the process of text generation by a language model is **actively controlled or guided** using additional, dynamic signals derived from the retrieval process, the nature of the task, or external agent-like components.

**Breaking Down the Components**

- **Retrieval metadata:** This refers to information about the retrieved documents, such as relevance scores, document order, source type, timestamps, or other attributes attached to retrieved items. The generation model uses this metadata to influence how it interprets or integrates retrieved evidence—e.g., prioritizing highly relevant documents, calibrating confidence, or conditioning responses differently based on document trustworthiness or recency.
- **Task-specific cues:** Generation can be tailored based on explicit or implicit signals related to the specific task at hand. For instance, in biomedical QA, the system might require stricter factual grounding; in summarization, the model may favor brevity or coverage. These cues help the generation model adjust its behavior (style, depth, faithfulness) according to the goals or constraints of the query.
- **Agentic decision-making:** Here, an agent or controller (which could be an auxiliary model or a rule-based system) actively decides, at each stage or even during generation, how to incorporate retrieved evidence, when to fetch more information, or whether to trust the model’s internal memory over external sources. Agent-based approaches like AU-RAG let an agent dynamically switch between using parametric (internal) knowledge and non-parametric (retrieved) evidence based on contextual factors.

**What Modulation Means in Practice**

Rather than passively consuming whatever context is retrieved, these systems **dynamically adjust**:

- How much weight to give each retrieved document.
- Whether to insert, ignore, or emphasize certain facts.
- When to trigger additional retrieval steps or fallback to model’s internal beliefs (parametric knowledge).
- How to calibrate confidence or certainty in the output based on retrieval confidence or external agent commands.

**Examples**
- **AU-RAG’s agentic control:** An agent decides for each part of an answer whether to cite retrieved evidence or to rely on internal parametric memory, adapting strategies for different sub-tasks within a complex query.
- **Confidence-calibrated generation:** The model may phrase outputs with varying degrees of certainty based on metadata about the strength of retrieved evidence (e.g., "Based on recent studies retrieved...").
- **Task-aware prompts:** Output format and content are adapted to best fit the information needs specific to a question type (e.g., clinical diagnosis vs. trivia QA), guided by cues about the nature of the task.

**Summary**
This strategy makes RAG generation more **context-aware, adaptive, and trustworthy** by leveraging retrieval information, task requirements, and intelligent decision modules to actively shape the generated output, rather than relying on a fixed or static pipeline.

## Example Hybrid RAG Strategies

- **Iterative or Multi-Round Retrieval:** The system alternates between retrieving documents and generating answers in several rounds. For example, IM-RAG simulates an “inner monologue” where evidence is repeatedly refined as the answer builds up. GenGround generates an initial answer, then seeks supporting evidence to modify or justify it, supporting interpretability for complex queries.
- **Utility-Driven Joint Optimization:** Retrieval and generation are updated together, often using reinforcement learning to maximize utility. Stochastic RAG treats retrieval as an expected utility maximization problem, while M-RAG uses multi-agent reinforcement, with distributed retrievers/generators sharing memory and task-specific roles.
- **Dynamic Retrieval Triggering:** Retrieval can be triggered during generation, not just before. For instance, DRAGIN activates retrieval at the token level using entropy-based signals, while FLARE selectively retrieves when the model is uncertain about the next word or sentence. Self-ROUTE routes tasks dynamically between retrieval/generation based on difficulty estimation, and TA-ARE uses classifiers to decide if/when retrieval is necessary and what granularity is needed.
- **Corrective Mechanisms:** Frameworks like CRAG evaluate the quality of retrieved evidence before generation and decide to proceed, re-trigger retrieval, or decompose the input if necessary, tightly linking retrieval and generation assessment under uncertainty.

**Advantages of Hybrid RAG Systems**
- **Better handling of under-specified or evolving queries:** By treating retrieval as an ongoing, contextual process, hybrid systems adapt to queries where information needs may change during answering.
- **Increased factuality and reasoning transparency:** Iterative feedback can correct hallucinations, integrate new evidence, and ensure every step in reasoning is grounded in retrieved information.
- **Robustness against noise:** By continuously verifying and updating their context, hybrid RAGs are less prone to be misled by initial irrelevant or noisy retrievals.

**Limitations**
- **Training Stability:** The co-adaptive and non-linear feedback between retriever and generator can complicate training and optimization.
- **Latency/Overhead:** Performing retrieval mid-decoding or in multiple rounds increases computation and may introduce delays.
- **System Transparency:** The complexity of dynamic interactions can make it harder to debug or interpret system behavior.

Hybrid RAG systems **move beyond static pipelines**, enabling **contextual, multi-step reasoning** and **robust answer construction** through joint retriever-generator adaptivity. They are especially useful for open-domain QA, long-context summarization, and domains demanding complex evidence aggregation.
