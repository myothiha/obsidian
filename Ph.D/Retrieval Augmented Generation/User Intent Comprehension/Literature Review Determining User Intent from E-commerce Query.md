# Problem Statement

 We would like to comprehend user intention based on the user queries on e-commerce platform. Sometime, user queries can be ambiguous. For example, if a user search "Apple", should we show the food related product like apple pie, apple jam or electronic products like Macbook, iphone or apple watch. E-commerce platform like Amazon show the most popular products, in the case of "Apple", it shows Macbooks, iphones and Apple watches. So, we would like to create a AI-based retriever system, to discern the intention behind a user depending on current user market behavior and show the most relevant products to user. 

# Research Questions
- How do we know current market behavior for each keyword?
	- Is there any dataset?
	- Is there any API we can use?
- How do we evaluate the performance?
	- Any benchmark for user intent comprehension?
	- If not, can we create our own benchmark?

# Need to clarify
- Is it going to be static?
