# Use Metadata Filtering or ranking using the popular items. 

We can use intent classification as part of Metadata Filtering or ranking the products from the retriever. For example, we can map user's query into product categories and use that information to filter or rank the product. 

For example,

"Apple" -> 1. Electronic
