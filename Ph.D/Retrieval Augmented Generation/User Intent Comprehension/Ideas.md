# Use Metadata Filtering or ranking using the popular items. 

We can use intent classification as part of Metadata Filtering or ranking the products from the retriever. For example, we can map user's query into product categories and use that information to filter or rank the product. 

For example,

"Apple" -> 1. Electronic

# We need to have the dataset anyway

- Without dataset, we will not have no control over what kind of product we want to show because different region have different customer preference and behavior.
- We can use datasets to adapt the customer behavior overtime. 

**With the fixed dataset, it's going to be static since the model rely on the pattern of the dataset.**
## We need to find a complementary data source since our data source is not enough. 

We also need to implement hybrid approach where our dataset does not cover all the products. 

## Data Augmentation Approaches

- Can we find effective data augmentation approach to improve comprehensiveness of current dataset?
## Hybrid Approach
