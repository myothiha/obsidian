# What can we do?
- Improve efficiency (workflow automation)
- AI Power Innovation
- Simulation
	- Simulate business process using existing data.
	- Try decisions or pilot solutions on simulated environment first.
# AI Power Innovation

Increase velocity, volume and variety of Innovation process
- Identify problems
- Create solutions
- Evaluate and Identify the most promising solutions
	- Pilot and verified the solutions in simulated environment and/or actual environment

## Identify Problem/Features
- Synthesize a vast array of 
	- product reviews
	- social medical posts
	- customer service transcripts
	- Other source of customer data
- Identify market segments, product categories and features/function that would best address unmet needs of customers

## Create Solutions

Train foundational models to produce solutions such as
- chemical compounds
- drug candidates
- computer code
- electrical designs
- physical designs
- new products or services
- any other type of solutions application to any domain

Ideas Exploration
- Synthesize insights from published research articles and databases. 
- Knowledge base
	- Codify tacit knowledge (from the mind of employee) through transcribing and capturing recorded meetings.

Knowledge base for idea exploration

# AI Based Simulations

Use data to train AI to act as a simulator. Use data with AI to map, all possible "cause" and "effect" of the environment. It can simulate
- E-commerce
	- Consumer behavior -> Test new product before launch -> simulate consumer response to get early feedback (https://nielseniq.com/global/en/products/bases-ai-screener/)
- Smart Cities Industries
	- use physical simulators or actual data to make AI act as a virtual world that behave like a real environment.
	- Can be use to test how product or service react in simulated environment. 
- Scientific experiments
	- AI based Weather forecasting (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9)
