# Notes:

Build Daily Time Series

Model
- Conditional GAN
- Conditional Transformer

- LSTM can learn previous trend.
- Learn Statistics from the past.

Log Analysis
- Quantifiable data
- Slice data into different time slot with aggregated data (e.g hourly). 
	- Find error between - model output and real data RMSE. If there are a lot of model. 
- feature loss (time series)
	- compute why which feature make it anomaly. 
- Use: non-time series for interpret which features are affecting in deciding anomalies. 

Time series transformer model. 
- LSTM
- AutoFormer
