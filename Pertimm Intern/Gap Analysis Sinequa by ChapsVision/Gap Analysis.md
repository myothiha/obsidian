# Their Current Features
- Search
- Workflow
- Support Multi-modal

## Document Search
- Semantic Search - display a list of documents that match the query.
- AI Mode - QA over all connected content (all documents retrieved via semantic search?)
	- Find Info
	- Summarize retrieved info.
	- List key points regarding some aspect (i.e. security aspect)
	- Elaborate specific info
	- For each document, open the preview
		- Extraction: Search in document for this specific documents
		- Chat: QA over the document

## AI Workplace
- Add documents to the work space. 
- Threads: chat with AI assistant who use uploaded contents. Scope: updated contents.

- **Organization Specific AI (Mandatory)**
	- Data Accumulation mechanism (collect organization specific data.)
	- Adapt AI agents (fine-tuning) according to the organization related data.
	- Can utilize smaller Model => Reduce cost
	- Align AI agents with the organization interest => Improved Performance
