- Credibility Param count and training regime of TRM is confused with HRM
	- Create a slide for HRM vs TRM facts 
- Compute claim risk: I claim TRM require high VRAM. 
	- create a table of different compute requirements by use case.
- Overreach risk: Impacts and Application are too much of a leap.
	- Propose scoped validation plan. 
- Mixed with assumptions and official statements. And benchmarks are not the main concern.
